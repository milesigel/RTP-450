# RTP-450
Project 3 of COMP 450 - creating RTP planning algorithm within OMPL

NOTE ON HOW TO RUN plotPlanner.py

you will need to run it with the path and which enviornment to print.. for example

python3 ./plotPlanner.py pathbox.txt 2

^ this would be a valid call to the plotter

python3 <python plot file> <planner .txt information> <(1 or 2) the enviornment>
